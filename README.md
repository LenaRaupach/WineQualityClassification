Wine Quality Classification with Decision Tree

This project demonstrates a simple and intuitive Machine Learning example using a Decision Tree classifier to categorize wines as "good" or "bad" based on a few key chemical properties.

Features
- Uses the classic Wine dataset from scikit-learn with only 5 features for simplicity
- Binary classification into good (class 0) and bad wines (other classes)
- Easy-to-understand decision tree model with visualization
- Performance evaluation with accuracy and additional metrics
